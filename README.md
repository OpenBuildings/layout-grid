Static responsive grid with pure css.
Javascript using native Drag 'n drop to reorder for each screen size.

![Example Layout Grid](http://i.imgur.com/vtkdKg5.png "Layout Example")

Installation
-----------

For only static positioning include `css/layout-grid.min.css`
For ordering items around include `js/layout-grid.min.js`

Modification
------------
`sass/layout-grid.sass` allows you to modify a lot of variables for each screen size, overriding the defaults.
If you're using reorder you'll need to tell the javascript plugin about these modifications as well.

Development
-----------
After modification you can run the `npm install` and then `grunt` to build and minify all the js and sass. Use `grunt qunit` to execute the tests.
