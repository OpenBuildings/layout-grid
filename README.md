Static responsive grid with pure css.
Javascript using native Drag'n'drop to reorder for each screen size.

Instalation
-----------

For only static positioning include ``dist/layout-grid.css``
For ordering items around include ``dist/layout-reorder.css`` and ``dist/layout-grid.min.js``

Modification
------------
``sass/layout-grid.sass`` allows you to modify a lot of variables for each screen size, overriding the defaults.
If you're using reoder you'll need to tell the javascript plugin about these modifications as well.
