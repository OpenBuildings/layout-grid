Instalation
-----------

For only static positioning include ``css/layout-grid.min.css``
For ordering items around include ``js/layout-grid.min.js``

Modification
------------
``sass/layout-grid.sass`` allows you to modify a lot of variables for each screen size, overriding the defaults.
If you're using reoder you'll need to tell the javascript plugin about these modifications as well.

Development
-----------
After modification you can run the ``npm install`` and then ``grunt`` to build and minify all the js and sass. Use ``grunt qunit`` to execute the tests.
